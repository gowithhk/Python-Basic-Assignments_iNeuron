1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

Ans.

* is an Expression
'hello' is a Value
-87.8 is a  Value
- is an Expression
/ is an Expression
+ is an Expression
6 is a Value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans. 
String: String can be written in quotes such: "apple", 'apple'
Variable: It is the thing in which we can store data just like a container.

3. Describe three different data types.

Ans. 
1. List - An ordered sequence of items is called list. It is a mutable datatype.
2. Tuple - It is a sequence of items that are in a order. A tuple cannot be modified. It is immutable.
3. Strings - It is a sequence of characters.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Ans. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.
       Eg. x = x * 2
     Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

Ans. Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands) and the statement is just like a command that a python interpreter executes just like the print statement.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Ans.  23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

Ans. 'spamspamspam' will be the answer for both the statements.

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Ans. Because we cannot start the name of any varible with integers or digits. Therefore, eggs is a valid variable.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

Ans. int(), float(), str()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' 

Ans. Since, 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with a string. To fix this, we must convert the int to str using the str() function. This is also called typecasting.
'I have eaten' + str(99) + 'burritos'  is the correct statement.
